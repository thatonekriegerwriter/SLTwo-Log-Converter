02:14 - Truemisfit5340 said in OOC: Does Ice Point Guard count as a Parry Skill
02:14 - Dragonruby said in OOC: yes
02:22 - Raelynn said in LOOC: tbh im really proud of that script actually
02:24 - Raelynn said in Emote: looked at Lurexiel, and smiled. <b>"Evening, Conscrip, how may I help you?"</b>
02:25 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I'm here for my therapy. Have things I need to discuss.
02:26 - Raelynn said in Emote: couldn't hid her mild surprise. <b>"Normally we do schedule these things, but as I am free, I am willing to do so right now."</b>
02:27 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Let's do it, then.
02:29 - Raelynn said in Emote: Rae shuffled around the papers some, making sure thye had a Medical Record for Lurexiel, which they did, and gave a nod.

<b>"So, before everything else, I have some questions I need to ask you so we can set up the therapy portion of your medical record, just so you know."</b>
02:29 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Alright. Ask away.
02:32 - Raelynn said in LOOC: organizing my other monitor for this...
02:33 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod. 

<b>"I would like for you to describe a time you had to solve a problem creatively."</b>
02:34 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I had to save myself from a somewhat severe wound on my own, recently. So I grabbed a potion, grabbed some cotton, and had to make a makeshift bandaid that'd heal me up slowly.
02:34 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Thankfully that worked and I didn't catch a fever.
02:36 - Raelynn said in Emote: studied Lurexiel for a moment, before nodding. 

<b>"I'm quite glad you didn't catch a fever either, that's good to hear."</b>

<b>"Are there any thoughts you'd like to add about this time, or would you like to move to the next question?"</b>
02:37 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I'd like to move to the next question, mhm.
02:40 - Raelynn said in Say: You have a sequence of numbers: 2, then 4, then 6, then 8. What number comes next?
02:40 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: 10.
02:40 - Raelynn said in Say: What do a Lupine and a Felidae have in common?
02:40 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... strong physical strengths.
02:41 - Raelynn said in Say: "What is the opposite of the word 'expand'?"
02:41 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Shrink!
02:42 - Raelynn said in Say: "What is the name of the desert beyond Duyuei?"
02:44 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: The wastes. Beyond the wastes are the deep wastes...
02:44 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Emote: shivers.
02:45 - Raelynn said in Say: Explain the meaning of the phrase 'a lyra for your thoughts.'
02:45 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... I actually don't know about that one.
02:46 - Raelynn said in Say: That's perfectly fine, I believe that's as valid of an answer as any other.
02:47 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Then yeah, I don't know about that one.
02:47 - Raelynn said in Say: I'm going to move on to my other questions now, is that alright?
02:47 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Yep!
02:49 - Raelynn said in Say: I want you to only answer true or false to these ones, do you understand?
02:51 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Sure!
02:51 - Raelynn said in Say: I find it hard to trust people.
02:52 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: False.
02:52 - Raelynn said in Say: I have trouble controlling my temper.
02:52 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... false.
02:53 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... no, true, that's true.
02:54 - Raelynn said in Say: I have experienced hallucinations or unusual perceptual experiences.
02:55 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: False.
02:56 - Raelynn said in Say: I often have thoughts of harming myself or others.
02:56 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: False.
02:57 - Raelynn said in Say: I often feel paranoid or suspicious of others' intentions.
02:57 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: False.
02:57 - Raelynn said in Say: I often feel sad or hopeless about the future.
02:59 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: False!
03:00 - Raelynn said in Say: And that's all the questions I need to ask you.
03:03 - Raelynn said in Say: Well, except for one, I suppose. How are you feeling?
03:03 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... I've been feeling good! I mostly wanted to see if I'm a bit insane in the fact that I can't really erase my smile.
03:05 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: It's a good thing to keep my smile, yeah?
03:07 - Raelynn said in Say: It can be, yes, but not all the time. Sometimes, it's okay to express other feelings outwardly, especially here. 

You, at least with me, do not have to act as a prim and proper soldat in this room.

03:08 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... Thanks.
03:08 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Well.
03:08 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Emote: takes off her hat. Her grin someone turns into a caring, but casual one.
03:09 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I do want to arrange this as a way of... at least asking if I can do something.
03:09 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I tend to act out in the heat of the moment and I do want to fix that.
03:10 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod. <b>"I did the same thing once, asking if I could do something like that, not with my own therapist, but with... someone whom I hope is a friend."</b>

<b>"You are welcome to do so... but I will note it will not be held against you if you fail to do so."</b>
03:10 - Truemisfit5340 said in OOC: Is there a lava lake party that can take in two?
03:11 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Thanks, Raelynn. It really helps I can have a fallback plan - especially given I am living alone.
03:12 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod.

<b>"It's no problem."</b>

<b>"Is that something you'd like to talk about?"</b>
03:13 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: ... well, I kinda ran from my home after a year of having to... do things, but I think that's a story for another time. I held you here for a bit too long.
03:14 - Raelynn said in Emote: shook her head.

<b>"I do not have anything scheduled for the foreseeable future, Lurexiel, if you wish to talk about it, talk about it. If you aren't comfortable talking about it, that's okay to."</b>

<b>"This is time *for you*, not for me. Speak comfortably, and on what you want to speak about."</b>
03:15 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Emote: puts her hat back on.
03:15 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I'd say I'm not comfortable right now to talk about it. But next time, my heart will be open for you to see.
03:15 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Would that be okay?
03:17 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod and a smile.

<b>"That would be okay, but it would also be just as okay if you come in next time, and you still aren't ready to share, all you need to do is be honest about it."</b>

<b>"Do you wish to leave? Or just talk about your day, I imagine it was much more eventful than mine. Any choice is a good one, here."</b>
03:20 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I think I'll leave for now. Even if I didn't talk as much, I think - I can work with what I have now.
03:20 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: When should our next appointment be?
03:20 - Raelynn said in Say: I think you did a very good job today, Lurexiel, being honest that you aren't ready for something is very good.

I can schedule around when is best for you.
03:22 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: I think I'll have one scheduled once a (ooc week).
03:23 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod. <b>"That is perfectly acceptable for me."</b> We can hash out further details oocly as needed.
03:23 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Emote: nods.
03:23 - Raelynn said in Say: Would you like me to see you out?
03:23 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Then I take my leave. Thank you for the session - and sure.
03:24 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Also - you'll... see me doing something funky in the next time you see me at full power.
03:24 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: You ever heard of an Iron body?
03:24 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: ooc, do you have anything made out of boulder material
03:25 - Raelynn said in LOOC: I don't believe so?
03:25 - Raelynn said in Emote: 's posture changed some, dropping her Therapist headspace. 

<b>"I have not."</b>
03:25 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: It's fine
03:25 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: You'll see.
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Because I decided... that I'm doing something very funny... I'm not going to be evading things. And heading problems straight on.
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: if this build works
03:26 - Raelynn said in Emote: smiled. <b>"That's a good mindset."</b>
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: I'll have around 1000 effective hp pool on top of 60%/55% resistances
03:26 - Raelynn said in LOOC: ooooo
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: This is _with boxer damage_ btw
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: see you later!
03:26 - Raelynn said in LOOC: THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL IN PARTY LMAO
03:26 - Raelynn said in LOOC: yeah im hoppin off!
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Emote: smiles.
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in Say: Have a good day.
03:26 - Raelynn said in LOOC: gotta code more
03:26 - Raelynn said in Say: You too.
03:26 - Catastrophe Incarnate said in LOOC: bai!
