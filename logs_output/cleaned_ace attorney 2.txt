16:49 - FelTact said in OOC: anyone wanna help me grind? 
17:30 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: offers Rae a wave, in lighter spirits than he was before,

<b>"Oh, good morning, Raelynn. Are you doing well?"</b>
17:30 - Raelynn said in Emote: wasn't.

<b>"Hey, did you know a Duyueian Mark meant you are a citizen?"</b>
17:31 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Er.. I couldn't say I knew anything about that, no."</b> 
17:34 - Behemoth said in Say: It's common knowledge, for the most part 
17:36 - Raelynn said in Emote: pointed at herself. <b>"Memory loss."</b>
17:36 - Raelynn said in Say: and while I was memoryless, I joined Geladyne... without remembering I had a mark.
17:36 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: gives a soft sigh..

<b>"I suppose that means I'm left with only uncommon knowledge. I could, perhaps, get away with explaining my selective knowledge of Duyei with amnesia, too, however.."</b>

He glances over to Raelynn,

<b>"Well.. is that truly a problem? As far as I understand, joining Geladyne means renouncing citizenship regardless."</b> 
17:38 - Raelynn said in Say: I got told by a fellow soldat yesterday it is.
17:39 - Theodore said in Emote: waves and flops at a table. 
17:39 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"I see.. knowing your opinions on Duyei.. I wonder, perhaps, if there's a way to remove it?"</b> 
17:40 - Raelynn said in Say: I would think so.
17:40 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Somebody around here would have an answer, I'm sure."</b>
17:41 - Raelynn said in Say: Colby said he'd take a look today.
17:42 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: gives a soft laugh, 

<b>"Ah, Colby - ever reliable. I'm willing to provide my magic, if.. it'll help whatever solution he comes up with. It's the least I can do.."</b>

He pauses for a moment, and then gives Theodore an.. uncertain wave. Thoughts of what he might have overheard the night before put some anxiety into the motion.
17:43 - Raelynn said in Emote: was equally anxious about what he might just have heard.
17:43 - Theodore said in Emote: is too busy with his crippling cut wound to think about that.
17:44 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: <--- healer 
17:45 - Softly Spoken said in LOOC: oh noooo that arrow is going to be the wrong way around for everybody else
17:45 - Softly Spoken said in LOOC: lake time
17:45 - Theodore said in Emote: HE FEELS BETTER BLEEDING ON THE FLOOR THAN HE DOES ASKING FOR HELP.
17:46 - Theodore said in LOOC: DONT WORRY THE ART MAKES UP FOR IT
17:47 - Raelynn said in Emote: healer --->
17:47 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: pauses for a few moments, peering at the slumped man...

<b>"Are.. you quite alright?"</b> 
17:47 - Theodore said in LOOC: their all medics
17:47 - Theodore said in LOOC: ALL OF THEM
17:47 - Raelynn said in Say: aight man dont be a lil baby (omit)
17:48 - Softly Spoken said in LOOC: PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF
17:48 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: stands with a soft sigh, to step on over.. 
17:50 - Theodore said in Say: "Fine- fine. The fevers Healed itself. Just-" He looked around a bit awkwardly once he realized he'd been surrounded a little. "Uh- Its uh... a Cut wound is all. I'd fix it myself if I had what I needed." He groaned. 
17:52 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Ah. I'm sure we could spare some bandages. I've some cloth I've been treating with yama blinds for, er.."</b> he gestures vaguely to his right arm.. <b>"Recent issues."</b> 
17:53 - Raelynn said in Say: Considering he's a soldat, I can use my supplies on him without any problems.
17:54 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Very well."</b>
17:54 - Theodore said in Say: Aaaah... That reminds me. I found stuff you might like. Here.
17:56 - Raelynn said in Emote: looks... extremely happy, hugging the plushies.
17:56 - Theodore said in Emote: He handed over a pair of Monster plushies he'd found on his various outtings. "I remember you really seemed to like the one you got before." He nodded, immediatly moving to start fixing his own wounds. 
17:58 - Softly Spoken said in Emote: gives a soft laugh and a smile at the set of plushies.. 

<b>"Oh, yes, very adorable. I've found a few, myself, while on previous outings."</b>
18:00 - Raelynn said in Emote: looked to be doing a bit better. <b>"Colby suggested I just... talk to a Superior."</b>
18:01 - Theodore said in Emote: raised an eyebrow, tilting his head, and humming. 
18:05 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>".. I suppose that's for actually <i>resolving</i> the issue..?"</b> 
18:06 - Raelynn said in Say: It would be... the best way to handle it. They could get it removed easily, and I also... wouldn't be hiding it.
18:07 - Theodore said in Say: "Have I, er, missed something?" He asked, scratchign his head and leaning back after finishing his own bandaging. 

18:09 - Raelynn said in Say: Just medical problems.
18:11 - Theodore said in Say: "Ah, I see." he nodded, understanding quite clearly that was code for 'he didn't need to know'. 
18:14 - Raelynn said in Say: I know I *should* tell someone, but I'm... needing to find the confidence to leave.
18:16 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>".. Would it help if somebody went with you? I suppose that'd have to be Theodore by necessity, but.."</b> 
18:16 - Raelynn said in Say: I think I would rather handle it alone, honestly.
18:17 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"I see. That's understandable."</b>
18:19 - Theodore said in Emote: nodded, "I wont stick my nose where it isn't wanted. Well, not too much. You sure your gonna be ok? Sounds liek this is... serious."
18:20 - Raelynn said in Say: Being completely serious, if something goes wrong, I'd rather be the only Conscrip that gets in trouble.
18:24 - Behemoth said in Say: I wouldn't trust a decent chunk of geledyne higher ups to be honest
18:24 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Hm.."</b> 
18:24 - Theodore said in Emote: frowned and sighed. "Well, cant really argue with you, I wouldn't want to drag anyone down with me if it were me either." He admitted.
18:25 - Theodore said in Say: Though, I will remind you, your not a Conscrip anymore are you?
18:25 - Raelynn said in Say: I don't trust the- No, I am still a Conscrip.
18:26 - Raelynn said in Say: Even if.... CMO Engel, The Regent, the Grand Inquisitor... a few Inquistors actually, Cyrus, and my direct commanding officer all have made a note of my excellent performance and want me promoted.
18:27 - Raelynn said in Say: Wow, that sounded like I was full of myself.
18:27 - Theodore said in Say: "Not your fault everyone see's the value in you." He teased slightly. 
18:29 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"It does sound like you've made quite the name for yourself - and, to be entirely honest, I'm not surprised, Raelynn. Honestly, I'm rather inclined to imagine it'll be shrugged off."</b> 
18:32 - Raelynn said in Emote: relaxed some. <b>"Then I'm gonna head out."</b>
18:33 - Softly Spoken said in Say: <b>"Travel well, then, and best of luck."</b> 
18:33 - Theodore said in Emote: nodded. 
18:40 - Zangoo said in OOC: hey uhh
18:40 - Zangoo said in OOC: i j logged in and my entire inventory is just blank
18:40 - Zangoo said in OOC: like gone

18:57 - Elegant Erudite said in LOOC: hi <3
18:57 - Elegant Erudite said in LOOC: ilu gabby
18:57 - Elegant Erudite said in LOOC: YOU SEE THAT NEKO?
18:59 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"He may be a poumpous braggart, but his grasp of the financial situation a Geladyne is good. I was actually gonna suggest he join Finance an Logistics. We need more pompous braggarts to bloat the numbers."</b>
18:59 - Raelynn said in LOOC: lmao sends that in pms and walks in
18:59 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: I was GONNA say
19:00 - Raelynn said in LOOC: I WANTED TO READ FELS BOOK AGAIN
19:00 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: it's sitting on the table
19:00 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: i keep a copy on my person at all times
19:00 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"Teatime?"</b>
19:01 - Head Therapist said in Emote: shakes her head, <b>"Don't let him hear that, he's got enough of an ego as it is. That, and he'd wonder if you're not being sarcastic because he hasn't got a good grasp--- Ah, Raelynn, hello."</b>
19:01 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a wave, and a shrug, before picking Utopia off the shelf again.
19:01 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: raelynn looks so smol. like she's peering over the table. looking at cake.
19:01 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: archivist took it off the shelf sadly
19:01 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: Ciara already-- ye
19:01 - Raelynn said in LOOC: give her the cake
19:01 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: gotta... review it
19:01 - Raelynn said in LOOC: damn
19:02 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: but the book is ic on the table, open
19:02 - Raelynn said in Emote: paused. <b>"WHere book go?"</b>
19:02 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"T'review. You kin read the other copy in Telegrad, or on this table."</b>
19:02 - Raelynn said in Say: Table closer.
19:03 - Head Therapist said in Say: Did you seriously-
19:03 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"I made sixteen copies."</b>
19:03 - Raelynn said in Say: I read the book and I figured something like this would happen. I even took her to the Vale to leave one there.
19:03 - Head Therapist said in Say: <b><i>SIXTEEN COPIES?</i></b>
19:03 - Fel Bourbon said in LOOC: there's cookies and tea on the other side
19:04 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"Raelynn said to make copies an' distribute them to every nation an' town."</b>
19:04 - Raelynn said in LOOC: but rae wants to sit near Vic
19:04 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: doesn't grasp the political statement.
19:05 - Raelynn said in Emote: looked at Ciara. Why must Fel not have an indoors voice?
19:05 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: sets cookies and hibiscus tea in Raelynn's spot.
19:07 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"I sure hope this isn't problematic material you distributed wide solely because you figured it wouldn't get approval here. Fel's already been in hot water as is, I'd like to think you wouldn't be a poor influence to them."</b>

Suspicion is now placed on Raelynn. A lot of weird stuff had happened in such a short amount of time and this woman was prepared for it to never end.
19:08 - Raelynn said in Say: It's because as a Therapist, others may have similiar feelings of wanting something better as Fel. It's not anything subversive. Letting people not feel alone is important.
19:08 - Head Therapist said in Emote: raised an eyebrow at Ciara's words. Fel's been in hot water as it is... <b>"...Would you care to explain what exactly she means, Fel?"</b>
19:09 - Raelynn said in Emote: merely forgot who the author was.
19:10 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said. <b>"I'm in lotsa trouble. Um... you might be too."</b> 
19:10 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: felt bad, but she'd never be dishonest to a friend.
19:13 - Scarlet Sun said in LOOC: I return.
19:13 - Raelynn said in Say: I can figure I was getting in trouble either way, I was a slave for a while, I remember that now, but I got caught right after I got my Mark, and then those slavers made it a Tarnished mark.

I couldn't it it removed because, A. Tarnished, B. I *didn't remember I had the damn thing until recently.* C. I only learned yesterday it means I'm a citizen of fucking Duyuei.
19:14 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: I'm sorry, what?
19:14 - Raelynn said in Emote: didn't care anymore! Arrest her! Execute her! She wants to be a dumb therapist which, as she realizes , might be a crime in Geladyne!
19:14 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"I don't mean about the dual citizenship thingy... I didn't even tell anyone that."</b>
19:14 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: pointed at the Keiton. Right there.
19:14 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"Just... be open and honest with people. I'm sorry. Th' Regent will sort this out."</b>
19:14 - Raelynn said in Say: I know she's right there! I'd would love for the stupid mark to be removed because I literally had no fucking memory of having it because I got here and concented to joining the Geladynian Military when I had no concept of what LANGUAGE was, much less important things like Rank and Nationality.
19:14 - Raelynn said in Emote: is actually really really frustrated.
19:14 - Head Therapist said in Say: <b>Raelynn.</b> Calm down..
19:15 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: said, <b>"Ciara's uh. She's going to report anything you say, you know? And it won't come off in a good light. Just... wait fer miss Astrales t'call on you an' be honest with her, okay?"</b>
19:16 - Head Therapist said in Emote: was, at first, rather taken aback and shocked by the outbursts. Only for there to be more to it, and it ends up causing her to stand up. Narrowing her eyes. <b>"Shall we take this conversation somewhere else? Or would you like to enlighten me on what's going on in private yourself, Ciara?"</b>
19:20 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Beyond what is ultimately someone seeking information on spycraft and intimidation tactics, more fancily known as 'Dark Finance' in their words, and dropping the hint that it's the talk of the town and more people might be involved, well... I'll be real, I'm not sure where the whole Duyuei Tarnished thing comes into it. I just know that I'm pretty damn sure that Duyuei will be very pissed if they found out we were harbouring you."</b>

That was about it. She mused, <b>"Clearly the former expands into a web beyond even my knowledge, and where it goes, well... you're not authorised to know that much. Likely some inquisition or praetorian or... who knows what kind of business. All I knew was that it's pretty hot water to go openly seeking stuff like that and that it's a serious issue to have multiple people in on it.

Anything else? Beyond me. Not a clue."</b>

From there, <b>"Yeah, not going anywhere, actually. I'll be detaining Raelynn from here, just to expedite the process of, y'know... actually getting things seen to. No punishment or anything, that's not really my problem, but... uh. I'm obviously not gonna have you walking out on that statement if it -is- a problem."</b>
19:21 - FelTact said in OOC: anyone doing 20-40s? 
19:21 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: rubs her face. She feels like her curse is really going crazy now.
19:22 - Scarlet Sun said in Say: . . .
19:23 - Raelynn said in Emote: has a large amount of emotions, none of them pleasant, on her face.
19:23 - Head Therapist said in Emote: felt like she's being caught between a rock, a hard place, and the Inquisition or similar right now. All while having absolutely no power to intervene in any of it. While she'd object to someone under her being detained, and things involving <i>her daughter</i> seemingly being kept from her...
19:24 - Head Therapist said in Emote: There's nothing she can do besides grind her teeth in frustration. Curse you, Geladyne.
19:24 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: cat
19:25 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: sipped her tea... <b>"On the bright side, e-even if the Regent's all disappointed in me, she said she looked forwards to my future...?"</b> Fel didn't know which statement was more true, but she wore anxious eyes.
19:25 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: will not leave my desk alone
19:26 - Scarlet Sun said in Emote: was...obviously processing everything after she had come back too- slowly wrapping an arm around the Bourbon beside her again. The Sun looked over to Raelynn for a time. "Is that so. . .? Well. . .it is true you have a bright future, sis."
19:26 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: is wearing the expression that reads she fucked up.
19:26 - Raelynn said in Emote: let her face hit the desk, mumbling things about Erika under her breath.
19:27 - Scarlet Sun said in Emote: was namely just....embracing them for a moment...despite the expression on the Bourbon's face. She seemed to be muttering some stuff under her breath.
19:29 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: whispered, <b>"But th' Regent kin be r, really scary, sis..."</b>
19:29 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Well, it's simple enough, really. Just come with me. If you believe things will be okay, then I'm sure they'll be so. But the mark of a tarnished is a big thing in Duyuei, and I'm not going to be a scapegoat for letting the knowledge wander upon knowing about it. Geladyne might not want to get on Duyuei's bad side by harbouring you, or they might help cover it up. I can't really tell you."</b>

She shrugs, <b>"I can just say I'd probably get in trouble if I said nothing and they found out anyway."</b>

She wasn't particularly one for making this aggressive. She wanted it to just be simple and smooth. It wasn't for her to determine what the end outcome would be.
19:29 - Head Therapist said in Say: <b>Would you allow me to come as well, Ciara?</b> Given she is one of my employees. And Fel is my <b>daughter.</b> So it would stand to reason I should know what she's been up to.
19:30 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: You can come as far as the waiting room of the prison, and from there it's completely up to the inquisition. Not me. So follow if you may, really.
19:31 - Head Therapist said in Say: I suppose we'll just have to see if the Inquisiton feels kind enough to fill me in.
19:31 - Fel Bourbon said in Emote: whimpered. <b>"Please don't go too far, mama. Even if the star shines."</b>
19:31 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: I'll be real, though - I'm not particularly sure how threads weave between 'Dark Finance' and being a Duyuei Tarnished. Far as I know, these are two completely different things.
19:31 - Scarlet Sun said in Say: Vic. . .you go on. I'll stay with Fel.
19:32 - Raelynn said in Say: Sorry, Vic.
19:33 - Head Therapist said in Say: I don't think you've truly done anything wrong, given your amnesia.
19:33 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: ...Well, now we wait, ultimately.
19:35 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Terribly sorry for the inconvenience, and all. But last I checked being a tarnished is a pretty big thing, so I'm going to need to pass you over to the inquisition so they can determine what is and isn't the law regarding these things. It'll just be a formality if everything's truly fine."</b>

That was all the Umbral had to say. She hadn't really lived this kind of experience before. Never had a Duyuein Tarnished hidden amongst the ranks.
19:36 - FelTact said in OOC: early levels are a bitch as a summoner 
19:36 - Raelynn said in Emote: rubbed her head, before giving a pathetic laugh. <b>"At least the Grand Inquisitor likes me."</b>
19:37 - Head Therapist said in Say: I don't... Think that you've done anything entirely wrong either, Ciara. In the end, we're at the mercy of the Inquisition and their judgment... And what the laws are surrounding it and Duyuein society.
19:37 - Raelynn said in Say: The Duyueian I told about my situation last night laughed at me a little.
19:37 - Raelynn said in Say: He didn't say why.
19:38 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Well, if we're being real here, a fleeing Tarnished is in all likelyhood execution, so...
19:38 - Head Therapist said in Say: But she didn't-
19:38 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Last I checked for Duyuei being a tarnished is your last warning. And what a heck of a warning it's meant to be...
19:40 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Not sure how you ended up with the mark, though.
19:40 - Head Therapist said in Say: Probably best you explain your situation...
19:40 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Well, not to me. Doesn't matter what I know.
19:41 - Head Therapist said in Say: To the Inquisition or otherwise.
19:42 - Raelynn said in Emote: , for once in her life, took off her cloak, and now was just in uniform. <b>"I had a shit run, honestly. Not good enough to be a Warrior, tried my damnest to be a good Mender, ended up becoming a Doctor, and I wanted to be the most damn fine Doctor on Korvara."</b>

<b>"I went back to get my Mark, and I got one, wasn't tarnished yet, helped out treating patients at the wall, and it went... wrong. I... umm.. lost one... and it was entirely my fault."</b>

<b>"I umm... afterwards, resolved to do better, wanted to be a better Doctor than before, but on my way back to med school... they umm... caught me, and told me I was responsible, and tarnished me, I remember where the mark is."</b>

<b>"I was just kind of a slave doctor after that... for a long time, until one day, they got attacked, and I managed to start getting away, and got my head wounded running off."</b>

<b>"Eventually I wandered here."</b>
19:45 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Personally, I'm not sure if it's better or worse you know exactly how it went for you. I mean, if it were just amnesia and a lack of memory there'd be a good case for the idea that you're not really the same person who committed the crime anymore, and that we'd be fine to keep you under us."</b>

She then stated, <b>"But you know the circumstances, which means an intentional flee from that kind of thing. Maybe they'll sympathise, or maybe it'll be a problem."</b>
19:46 - Raelynn said in Say: I remembered while doing surgery on Erika,
19:46 - Raelynn said in LOOC: WHAT A WAY FOR VIC TO LEARN ABOUT THAT GOD
19:50 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: hello everyone and welcome to the wait for inquisition, I'll be your host for today, the fucking librarian
19:51 - Raelynn said in LOOC: secret inquisitor: librarian
19:51 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: bring your books back or it's jail
19:51 - Raelynn said in LOOC: by the end of this Ciara has going to have so many feelings
19:51 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: she's used to it
19:51 - Head Therapist said in Say: You... You remembered it recently? And while doing surgery on someone...-?
19:52 - Raelynn said in Say: I remember most things while in high pressure medical situations. My memory only started coming back after Cyrus passed out on the beach.
19:52 - Head Therapist said in Say: But--
19:52 - Raelynn said in Emote: avoided Asmodeus's eyes.
19:52 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <i>walks in</i>.

She sees Raelynn and Ciara.

There is an instantaneous 'oh no'.

<b>"... well."</b>
She tilts her head.

<b>"I suppose I should be glad nobody has attended you all yet."</b>
19:53 - Head Therapist said in Emote: ends up being cut off by the Inquisition arriving. Instead, gazing towards Asmodeus.
19:53 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: raises a salute to the Keiton.

<b>"Please inform me of the situation."</b>
19:53 - Rookie Advocate said in LOOC: forgot I logged out there, but hey I'll work with it
19:55 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"So, uh... we'll keep things simple. Raelynn here is a Tarnished of Duyuei."</b> She'd state, simply. She paused for a moment, before elaborating, <b>"A runaway, essentially, from the last stop before execution in Duyuein customs. And being allies with the nation, I figured it was best to bring them to the inqusition to mull over whether we, uh... care or not."</b>

She'd state, <b>"I don't imagine Duyuei would be happy with us harboring one, and as it stands they're freely able to share this with anyone. So... seemed like a good idea to turn them over to you for you guys to either decide whether or not she's fine to remain a soldier or needs sending back. In the event she's fine to be a soldier I would recommend swearing her to secrecy on this, and looking into the mark of a tarnished she has."</b>
19:57 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: seems to lose a moment of composure, batting her eyelashes and blinking. Not only was it a surprise, but there was... another reason. She raises her right-hand to her chin, and looks between those present at the seats, and then back to the Advocate at the side.

<b>"... I figure it would be best if we made a discussion out of this deeper inside. There is the prisoner's mess room at the second floor we can go to for the sake of security. Please, follow me."</b>
19:57 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: motions for the Advocate to move with her short arms.
19:58 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Should I come along, or do you just need Raelynn?
19:58 - Head Therapist said in Say: I'd... <i>Also</i> like a word, personally, but I suppose the call is yours.
19:58 - Raelynn said in Emote: 's direct superior IS Victoria.
19:59 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: The Therapist's also here about Dark Finance.
19:59 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: ... Since you are personally involved and a Keiton, it would be <i>good</i> to have you. But you are not necessarily required, <i>no</i>, especially since as this is not necessarily a time-pressing issue as of yet -- I can merely ask you for your personal opinion on the matter at a later date.

As for you, Bourbon -- I will say that I cannot promise that your voice will be heard as this is a matter pertaining to an international <i>risk</i>, but you are welcome as I will, personally, listen to you--
19:59 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: <b>"What."</b>
19:59 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: <i>Again, the same day?</i>
20:00 - Rookie Advocate said in LOOC: sorry family
20:00 - Head Therapist said in Emote: was there for <b>many</b> reasons. Even if she didn't seem to've been as registered. Having been putting things together in her head. Only for <i>that</i> to come out.
20:00 - Head Therapist said in Say: <i>...I suppose? More, to know what in the <b>world</b> Fel's been up to.</i>
20:00 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: More specifically, she's family to Fel, and she's hearing a lot of hushed tones and secret things about this person. But all I know of is Dark Finance.
20:01 - Raelynn said in Emote: couldn't help it, she was SO stressed, and the second the words "Dark Finance" came out of the woman's mouth, she started laughing.
20:01 - Head Therapist said in Say: My main, direct concern at the moment is Raelynn, howeve-
20:01 - Head Therapist said in Emote:  
20:01 - Rookie Advocate said in Emote:     

20:02 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: ... Not surprised. Well, let us put this whole 'dark finance' theme on the backburner for now. We have more pressing matters. 

So, to reiterate and avoid derailment: Ciara, you may come if you'd like. The same is extended to you, Bourbon. If you do not choose to come, since you are personally involved, I will notify you as to the results and intentions, and after communicating with my personal superiors, a result will be had.

The Privit here will join us to support me, and worry not, he is tight-lipped. For if he wasn't...
20:02 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: doesn't finished.

<b>"Now, all relevant and interested, come with me. Of course, Raelynn, you <i>must</i> come. Follow me."</b>
20:02 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: doesn't finish*
20:02 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: exhaust
20:02 - Raelynn said in Say: Sorry, sorry for laughing, ma'ams, just... I'm quite stressed.
20:02 - Raelynn said in Emote: immediately got up to follow.
20:03 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: Ahh..
20:04 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"Please take a seat. We're making the most out of the space we're given."</b>

Says Asmodeus, motioning forth whilst holding the cell open.
20:04 - Rookie Advocate said in Emote: would just pull out a notebook and just take notes on the matter.
20:04 - Raelynn said in Emote: had her cloak off, for once.
20:05 - Head Therapist said in Emote: has the seat she was going to go for taken, alas. So she sits near the other who isn't the 'accused' or the not-lawyer. Mildly unsure of how to behave besides <i>as best as she can.</i>
20:05 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: time to start up the testimony theme.
20:06 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: sits down and lands her arms on the table. Then, they raise over to curl, one hand to another as she gazes amongst all present.

<b>"Let me start this by being honest and saying what everyone needs to hear: this is a potential international incident. All here understand what this <i>implies</i>. 
Due to that, it is a matter of utmost serenity, especially since our current relationship with Duyuei is a <i>precipice</i>. If word of this got out, it would mean great trouble not only for Raelynn and those related to her, but for all of Geladyne and its future plans.

Granted, this trouble would not be <i>insurmountable</i>, but it would take great effort to make up for such damages."</b>
20:06 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: seriety*
20:06 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: chat im cooked
20:06 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: severity.
20:07 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: didn't know you're artemis tho.
20:07 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod. 
20:07 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"Therefore, I will now say the two most likely outcomes of this situation. And word of this does <i>not</i> leave this room.

One, we hand off Raelynn to the Duyueian authorities. Or two, we take every possible turn that will lead to our <i>present</i> Raelynn from being completely scrubbed from their perception.

Now, the reason why I ask you to keep these two possibilities silent is because, if we are speaking of <i>optimal circumstances</i> -- we should not <i>bother</i>. We should simply hand off Raelynn and be done with it.

However, <i>we have an alternative</i>, and I believe that <i>everyone present</i> prefers that. Am I wrong?"</b>
20:08 - Raelynn said in Emote: seemed a little flattered at the suggestion, she feels quite honored even though in her opinion she's a massive piece of shit who deserves to be in jail.
20:10 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"I should forewarn that the people in this room aren't the only ones at present to know this secret. Kara Ritters and Fel were both also present as this was blurted out, though it's implied that at least one of them knew regardless of the word getting out. That means to say, there are other people you'd need to hush if we're keeping this under the hood, and Raelynn would likely have to tell us of -everyone- who currently knows to aid in this."</b>

She didn't really have anything to weigh in for or against covering for Raelynn. Either they did or they didn't - she just wanted to provide the logical set of information needed in that this room wasn't everyone who knew.
20:12 - Head Therapist said in Emote: nodded when it came to the newly presented information. Given it was <b>true</b> and all. But it didn't bode very well for Raelynn... <b>"But at the same time, until recently, Raelynn had been suffering from amnesia. And we don't know <i>how much</i> had been known by either of the parties not here."</b>
20:14 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <i><b>"In that case, they should have been here. And Raelynn should have approached a relevant authority in the first place instead of bringing up the information to other people."</b></i>

The Grimm points out the obvious, before shaking her head.

<b>"We will work with what we have then. As we have a <i>consensus</i> as far as I can see, I will fetch them later, and will speak to them -- especially to <i>Fel</i> given how loose-lipped she seems to have been, and figure out a way to <i>gag</i> them regarding the subject. I will resort to <i>curses</i> if I have to.

Now, there is an ultimatum in place. If we are all motioning for your <i>oblivion</i> regarding your origins, Raelynn, then I must tell you that no matter what, <i>you</i> are the one that must remain quiet about all of it. If you find yourself incapable of this, <i>tell me</i>, so that I may come up with countermeasures with the resources that are available to us. For if you <i>do</i> leak this, or <i>anyone else does</i>, after we take the effort to conceal you--

Then I am afraid to say that I do not have the power to save you. You will be sent off to Duyueian authorities <i>by us</i>, and you will most likely, therein, be executed by them if you are not <i>lucky</i> to be forgiven for escaping their territory as a Tarnished."</b>
20:15 - Head Therapist said in Say: <b>Given Fel is my <i>daughter,</i> you'll do no such thing.</b> I'll tell her to keep quiet about it, should it be necessary.
20:16 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: I <b>will</b>. Do you prefer one of your daughters <i>cursed</i> for the safety of another, or said person <i>dead</i> for their misdeed?
20:16 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: Now then. Raelynn -- carry on.
20:16 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: N-Now now... Lets not get too loud. 
20:17 - Raelynn said in Say: ....A Doctor at the Vale knows, Fel, obviously, Kara. A friend of mine at the Vale. The people at the Vale know to keep it secret.

That doctor said he actually might have the experience to remove it, but suggested I admit it to a superior before he did so.

...Kuroun knows... she's the one who told me to hide it.
20:18 - Head Therapist said in Emote: isn't about to get into a shouting match with a superior. Merely shaking her head in frustration. She's also not going to correct the 'one of'. Hearing the final name causes her eyebrow to raise, though.
20:18 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: The information has left our walls already. This is... alarming to say the least, considering Geladyne cannot exercise any control over the situation over there. You've -really- gotten yourself into a pickle.
20:18 - Raelynn said in LOOC: did asmodeus call rae vics kid
20:19 - Raelynn said in LOOC: im fully expecting the rookie there to ask to see the tarnished mark imo
20:20 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: do your defence lawyer job......
20:20 - FelTact said in OOC: anyone able to help with grinding? 
20:20 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: yell objection, slam the desk, and throw your badge in Asmodeus' face as evidence
20:20 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: nods.

<b>"Thank you for informing me of that. 

In that case, we'd do well to <i>not</i> establish communications to them regarding the seriety of the situation. If they <i>are</i> to leak it, then it is best if we leave them unaware that your superiors <i>know</i>. Let them believe that they are the only ones who do. That works in our benefit.

Conversely, I am not worried about Kuruon. There are many secrets that Omina is aware of, and she hasn't leaked <i>any of them. Kara </i>may` be a concern given her track-record, but she is most likely to report to the Regent than to Duyuei, so we can merely ignore it for now after speaking to her and Fel on the matter.

Most importantly, I believe it is best that we focus on our methods."</b> 
20:20 - Raelynn said in LOOC: defend her lawyer
20:20 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: then save-state go back in time because you used up your last fuck up point
20:22 - Rookie Advocate said in Emote: wanted to say something, but had no idea where to start with all of this. 
20:22 - Raelynn said in LOOC: come on man
20:22 - Raelynn said in LOOC: You start with "HOLD IT!"
20:23 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"Raelynn, I will be truthful and brutally honest with this: I have been in Geladyne for thirty years now, and in my humble opinion, I believe it would be preferred if you changed identities <i>entirely</i>. 

Underwent surgeries to alter your physicality and deem you recognizable to those who know your face, changed your name, on <i>top</i> of removing the mark within your hand. That is preferrable.

However, if we choose to take a <i>risk</i>, simply dealing with the mark will suffice. The only problem is that if you share the name with this <i>previous self of yours</i>, on top of the <i>race</i>, then both of these serve as huge vulnerabilities towards your anonymity."</b>
20:23 - Raelynn said in Say: ...within my hand? It's on my back.
20:23 - Head Therapist said in Say: ...Why don't you show us?
20:23 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: How big is it?
20:24 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: asks the Grimm.

To the Therapist's question, she gazes over, before shaking her head.

<b>"I would rather not sharing the knowledge of how the mark of a Tarnished look to those present due to the vulnerability involved, but... we may excuse that for the sake of future planning."</b>
20:24 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: Please, do as she asks.
20:29 - Raelynn said in Emote: unbuttoned her military jacket, down to her white undershirt.

The Rookie COULD see a faint glow under her shirt, but it's not black mark. It's the Mark of an Annuin.

Even more unforunatetly, the mark is clearly where the poor girl can't see it.

She lowers the back of her shirt and shows the others.

There IS a Mark of an Annuin, but beside it is clearly someones *horrible* attempt to make a Filled Black Star of a Tarnished, it's inked in, with the wrong ink, and isn't even shaped correctly. The Tattoo isn't even Arcane.
20:30 - Head Therapist said in Emote: stared at the mark, and the rather shoddy attempt to colour it in with the wrong ink. Blinking over and over to make sure she isn't just seeing things, and even muttering to herself. <i>"So that's why things didn't add up..."</i>
20:31 - Rookie Advocate said in Emote:     
20:32 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: exhales softly. She does not appear shocked at all at the viciousness of it, and remains professional beyond her outward exhale.

<b>"I see. I may have an idea as to how to deal with this. We'll have to study it first and see whether it has any countermeasures against removal, then, check if it has any impact upon your soul and focus body, and <i>then</i>, decide how to proceed. 

From the elucidation that Ocypete has offered me over the years, I fear that the best way to handle this is not to simply remove the mark, but <i>overwrite it</i> with one grander. 

Given the alignment of Duyueian towards punitive measures, it is likely that this one bears a <i>curse</i> or the imprint of one, so said subject would <i>likely</i> be that of <i>another curse</i>.

Now I know how this sounds, but do not despair. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It means this most definitely can be done."</b>
20:35 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"I would like to ask about the circumstances behind it, but you are an amnesiac, and it is irrelevant moreover. Knowledge of what exactly had happened to lead to this would only be necessary if <i>something</i> goes wrong and a wrench is thrown into our potential arrangement, and truth be told--

upon that point, knowing this information would be useless anyways, and mostly harmful to us."</b>

She raises from her position, and steps back towards Raelynn.

<b>"With all of this in mind, let us call this an open discussion. Everyone -- say what you desire, but refuse to inquire on Raelynn's history. The less we all know -- the better."</b>
20:35 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Hmm."</b> The Phantom looks at the mark.

<b>"The Duyueins take great pride in their mark system, and use a special kind of blood, supplied from a felled behemoth they keep far away. From the looks of this marking, none of the care's shown. Rare considering such a thing would be doled out by people of higher rank usually..."</b>

She muses, <b>"Where did you get this from again? This is more than likely fake. A false alarm, though again, erring on the side of caution in that claim, we can't be sure enough to fully ease up."</b>
20:36 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: casts her eyes off towards the Phantom. What she says next bears no doubt in it, only <i>shock</i>, for it meant a positive circumstance.

<b>"Are you certain?"</b>
20:37 - Head Therapist said in Say: Going off all of this... I think I have an idea of what's happened.
20:38 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: had to go deal with IRL or I'd've typed more.
20:38 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: Housemate was raving about the door being unlocked but wouldn't say why or who did it
20:39 - Raelynn said in LOOC: the amount of communication with Torah over this was not small
20:39 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"As I've said, not certain enough for comfort. Not certain enough to hedge my bets on - but it looks -incredibly- lazy with mind to the fact that these are meant to be the identifier on all Duyueins. The only way we could confirm it without a shadow of a doubt is to see the mark of a Duyuein. Though under the pretenses, we couldn't share our reasons with them, I'm sure there are many ways to get a Duyuein to show their mark."</b>

She shrugged, though, <b>"It's hard to tell. You're pretty attuned to the arcane, aren't you, Asmodeus? The Duyueins love their curses, and a behemoth being used for all marks must have some incredible blood, especially in the case of punishment. Do you notice anything from the ink?"</b>
20:39 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: it's fake, ye?
20:40 - Raelynn said in LOOC: mhm
20:40 - Raelynn said in LOOC: its a fake
20:40 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: If I recall, for Duyuei, this would be akin to what we do here right? Dishonorable Discharge or something like that?
20:40 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Nope. This is an eternal life sentence. Punishment for crime by servitude. Slavery as discipline.
20:41 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"... Naturally attuned from creation, yes. But not educated in it. I would say that said attunement makes me incompatible to in-depth learning, but...

I can definitely make certain of this."</b>

She thanks the Keiton with a nod, and steps forward on towards Raelynn. She approaches closely -- a cold, rumbling hum of purple overflowing from her eyes, halo, and horns, as she begins to analyze it more closely.

What is the verdict, Systero?
20:42 - Raelynn said in Emote: 
There wasn't a curse on that mark.
20:42 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: That's....Cruel...
20:42 - Raelynn said in Emote: had seized up hard. 

"I-it's f-fake? All th-that time and its FAKE?!?!"



She starts laughing really hard.



"I had a man DIE at that wall because I fucked up that fucking and some fourth rate BASTARDS come after me saying the Chief sent them after me because of that shit! I don't fucking know who did it, only that they carted me around for YEARS making me heal their fucking men as they fucked around and eventually got shot in the head by fucking RANGERS, and you mean to tell me I could have FUCKED OFF BACK TO MEDICAL SCHOOL the ENTIRE TIME!"



"YEARS OF MY LIFE! BRAIN DAMAGE! ALL FOR WHAT!"
20:42 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: Hey, Calm down!
20:43 - Head Therapist said in Emote: kept a close eye on Asmodeus, interested to see if her suspicions were correct. And to see what she'd find out by examining her. <b>"All so that they could manipulate you into doing as they wanted. May they rot forever and never find rest."</b> The woman's arms cross at the outburst which... well. Confirmed it.
20:45 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"... No curses. At least none that has been activated. Though when it comes to focus, I am uncertain. But there is a high likelihood that this could still be used against her -- so we should proceed as we said."</b>

Says the Grimm, outstretching one hand to Raelynn's shoulder, and <i>clutching it</i>, seizing her. 

<b>"Raelynn, calm. I understand-- but it is beyond you now. You have better things. Now then..."</b>

She raises from her position, standing off to the side -- wondering how to go about this with this new information. She had already thought of preparations as to her original planning, but this... opened up a lot of segways. Too many.

<b>"<i>I will have to think about it.</i> I believe it would be best to adjourn this gathering and give the matter some time to simmer, and communicate this to my superiors. I will call for Fel and Kara as soon as possible -- for as even if the <i>mark</i> itself is fake, we cannot be certain how the Duyueian will react if there are rumors regarding it. And we do not know the Duyueian's view of you after the incident you mention.

... Not yet, anyhow."</b>
20:45 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: have been*
20:46 - Hallowed Grimm said in LOOC: gab try not to typo whilst being passionate challenge
20:46 - Raelynn said in LOOC: mood
20:46 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: patpat. to both.
20:48 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Relax, soldier."</b>

She echoes the concerns of the Advocate in that sense. Taking a breath.

<b>"Should have recognised it sooner, in all honesty - but these things are better handled by the inquisition anyhow. In all likelyhood, you ran into a group of people who either knew your situation or could make an educated guess simply enslaved you without actual backing. Can't really make an assessment on what you did or didn't do back home, but... you know, I think this is the first I've heard of people feigning a tarnished mark to act as slavers unchecked."</b>

She nods to the Grimm, <b>"Even if it's fake, though, we cannot guarantee that Duyuei wouldn't have given you one, either. Nor can we really confirm matters without essentially assuring there would be no way back if they did. You're still essentially a prisoner of potential."</b>
20:49 - Head Therapist said in Emote: would've echoed the same concerns, but her expression hopefully did the same. Showing her concern for someone she regarded very highly. Practically as an apprentice and valued member of the team even if still a Conscrip for the time being. <b>"I suppose at the end of the day, we need to make sure this doesn't reach Duyuei until we can confirm the situation. Correct?"</b>
20:51 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"Sounds like it, pretty much. Asmodeus will consult with her superiors, and in the meantime you're all still under the initial plan and agreement. Tell no-one, and ensure all soldiers who know are kept silent for the moment. You've got better chances in your favour, now, but all the same we need to retain the secrecy that was the plan in the first place."</b>

Well, hey, at least it was straying away from the idea that Raelynn would need complete facial reconstruction to become someone else, right? That was a positive...???
20:52 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: What about that <span class="clr_gre"> Vale Doctor</span> she mentioned?
20:53 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: Same plan. It's worse for us if we interface as higher ups with the problem outside the walls. Plausible deniability if nobody outside Geladyne knows higher ups know.
20:53 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: <b>"... In that case, we are adjourned. Do not speak a word of this, and wait for future orders. Bourbon -- you in particular, do me a favor and notify Kara and Fel. I am confident you can do this without agitating them.

However, I would like to ask that everyone besides Ciara and Raelynn leave. Right now. There is one thing I must mention to them specifically."</b>
20:53 - Raelynn said in Emote: finally looked calm, and had the... most frustrated look on her face.

<b>"Can I ask you all something first?"</b>

<b>"If something is your first case of accidental malpractice do you become a slave for it?"</b>

She's dumb.
20:53 - Head Therapist said in Say: I still need to have a word with you about Fel and what she's being doing... But I'll no-
20:53 - Head Therapist said in Say: -...No?
20:54 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: ... I will speak of that later, Raelynn. For now, sit down. I have information that will help you calm after this.
20:54 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: Everyone else -- go.
20:54 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: says, motioning out the cell.

<b>"Privit, please scout her out."</b>
20:54 - Bewitching Phantom said in Say: ...We're not trying you for another nation's crime, merely escaping an international incident.
20:54 - Head Therapist said in LOOC: escort.
20:54 - Head Therapist said in Say: I can see myself out, but seeing as you asked for him to leave as well... Indeed. See me out, if you'd please?
20:55 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: Y-Yeah.
20:55 - Rookie Advocate said in Say: Yes Ma'am...
20:56 - Raelynn said in Emote: looked down awkwardly. Oh no, they didn't get what she was asking and now the other Doctor is leaving.
20:56 - Head Therapist said in Say: She was asking if <b>it would be normal to be enslaved over one mistake.</b> Not if she was being tried again.
20:56 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: huffs. It is so heavy that one can see her chest move, even beyond the cover of her prim uniform.


20:57 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: ... I will put this simply -- and once more, this does not leave this room.
20:58 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: I have an alleyway to see if we <i>need</i> to do anything regarding this. There is one person in Duyuei in high-ranking that I am in contact with, and she is trustworthy towards anything that does not pertain to Duyueian safety.

I wish for you two to know -- Ciara, for you have brought this to my attention. And Raelynn -- for you are the individual in question and I am sure that the possibility will sooth you--...

That I may be able to conduct a test of the veracity of this mark with her, and even check if you have been inducted of any crimes after your leave. Your double-citizenship is still a problem, for I can see you were marked by them prior to your Tarnishing, but that may be simply resolved without incident.
20:59 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: That is all. Unless you have any inquiries, the two of you are now, also, free to go. Thank you for your time.
21:02 - Bewitching Phantom said in Emote: <b>"That should be everything. I'll leave this much in the hands of the inquisition for now, and trust that this does not end up any more of a problem than it needs to be."</b>

That was about that. The Umbral didn't really even have much stake in this, she was just a member of the Mannsehen and thus wasn't the kind of rank to just let revelations like this escape unsolved. She knows the risks of a problem unsilenced, after all.

<b>"There'll be no need to keep me updated. I'm just a messenger with regards to this matter, I have no stake in the outcome beyond this and thus have no need to oversee any part."</b>
21:03 - Raelynn said in Emote: gave a nod, before inhaling. 

<b>"I umm... what Vic said is what I meant. I do not believe anything will be found negative because I..."</b> She inhaled shakily. <b>"Made a mistake, it was accidental malpractice, not intentional. Any nation that makes Doctors slaves over accidental malpractice is a nation with no Doctors. It's why I so readily accept it to be a fake."</b>

<b>"Because the story makes more sense than otherwise. If I had done something wrong, why would they let me leave? Why would they, while I am a slave, make me still practice medicine for them if I committed such a crime."</b>

<b>"I come out of this feeling... relieved, but also... my pride sullied and used."</b>
21:04 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: offers a silent nod and drops her hands to her sides, under coat.

<b>"You are amnesiac. I have to check for the sake of your own safety, Raelynn. And Duyuei is no stranger to slavery. It is still in constant usage there."</b>

She says, closing her eyes and shaking her head.

<b>"You were not alarmed for nothing. Know that you have done right in speaking to us today. I only ask if something else comes up, that you elect to tell someone of relevance as quickly as possible. It is oft the best course of action."</b>
21:05 - Hallowed Grimm said in Say: Now, let me see the two of you out.
21:05 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: nvm ciara stays she belongs in there- fuck
21:05 - Bewitching Phantom said in LOOC: lmaooo
21:05 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: lets loose a loud exhale.

<b>"... All good. 

Privit? Don't make a report on this, and burn your personal notes. 
It is best left unwritten until Touma decides what comes out of it."</b>
21:06 - Hallowed Grimm said in Emote: then gazes over at the returning Raelynn. After doing her job, she deflates.

<b>"... Yes?"</b>
21:06 - Raelynn said in LOOC: oh i havent left yet
21:06 - Raelynn said in LOOC: was responding on discord
21:06 - Raelynn said in LOOC: ignore me
